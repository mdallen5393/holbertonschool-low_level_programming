PROJECT: 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

TASKS:
0. isupper - 0-isupper.c
	Function that checks for uppercase character and returns 0 if upper, 0 otherwise.

1. isdigit - 1-isdigit.c
	Function that checks whether the character is a digit; returns 0 if digit, 0
	otherwise

2. Collaboration is multiplication - 2-mul.c
	Function that multiplies two integers.

3. The numbers speak for themselves - 3-print_numbers.c
	Function that prints numbers 0 to 9.

4. I believe in numbers and signs - 4-print_most_numbers.c
	Function that prints the numbers 0 to 9, but not 2 or 4.

5. Numbers consititute the only universal language - 5-more_numbers.c
	Function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14.

6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line - 6-print_line.c
	Function that draws a straight line of a specified length in the terminal.

7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe - 7-print_diagonal.c
	Function that draws a diagonal line of a specified length on the terminal.

8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch - 8-print_square.c
	Function that prints a square of specified size.

9. Fizz-Buzz - 9-fizz_buzz.c
	Program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, print
	"Fizz" and for multiples of five print "Buzz".  For numbers that are multiples of
	both, print "FizzBuzz".

10. Triangles - 10-print_triangle.c
	Function that prints a triangle of a specified size.

ADVANCED TASKS (OPTIONAL):
11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic - 100-prime_factor.c
	Program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number
	"612852475143".

12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper - 101-print_number.c
	Prints an integer.

PROJECT: 0x09. C - Static libraries

TASKS:
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life - libmy.a, main.h
	Static library containing all functions listed below:
		_putchar, _islower, _isalpha, _abs, _isupper, _isdigit,
		_strlen, _puts, _strcpy, _atoi, _strcat, _strncat, _strncpy,
		_strcmp, _memset, _memcpy, _strchr, _strspn, _strpbrk,
		_strstr

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future - create_static_lib.sh
	Script that creates a static library called "liball.a" from all the
	".c" files that are in the current directory.

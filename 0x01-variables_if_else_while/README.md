PROJECT: 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

TASKS:
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing - 0-positive_or_negative.c
	Assign a random number to the variable 'n' each time it is executed.
	Print whether the number stored in the variable 'n' is positive or
	negative.

1. The last digit - 1-last_digit.c
	Assign a random number to the variable 'n' each time it is executed.
	Print the last digit of the number stored in the variable 'n'.

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game - 2-print_alphabet.c
	Print the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a newline using
	putchar.

3. alphABET - 3-print_alphabets.c
	Print the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by
	a new line, using putchar.

4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off - 4-print_alphabt.c
	Print alal the letters except 'q' and 'e', using putchar.

5. Numbers - 5-print_numbers.c
	Print all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from '0'
	followed by a new line.

6. Numberz - 6-print_numberz.c
	Print all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from '0'
	followed by a new line, without using type "char", using putchar.

7. Smile in the mirror - 7-print_tebahpla.c
	Print the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line,
	using putchar.

8. Hexadecimal - 8-print_base16.c
	Print all numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line,
	using putchar.

9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success - 9-print_comb.c
	Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-
	digit numbers, separated by ', ' in ascending order, using putchar.

ADVANCED TASKS:
10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need - 100-print_comb3.c
	Print all possible different combinations of two digits, separated
	by a ', '; digits must be different; "01" and "10" are considered
	the same combination of two digits '0' and '1'. Print only the
	smallest combination of two digits. Print in ascending order. Use
	putchar.

11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do... - 101-print-comb4.c
	Print all possible combinations of three digits, separated by ', ',
	where all three digits are different; 012, 120 are the same - only
	print the lowest; print in ascending order; use putchar.

12. Software is eating the World - 102-print_comb5.c
	Print all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated
	by ', '; Numbers should be printed as two digits (1 = 01); ascending
	order; 00 01 and 01 00 are considered the same; use putchar.

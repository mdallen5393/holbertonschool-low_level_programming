PROJECT: 0x0A. C - Dynamic libraries

TASKS:
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life - libdynamic.so, main.h
	Dynamic library containing all of the functions listed below:
		_putchar, _islower, _isalpha, _abs, _isupper, _isdigit,
		_strlen, _puts, _strcpy, _atoi, _strcat, _strncat, _strncpy,
		_strcmp, _memset, _memcpy, _strchr, _strspn, _strpbrk,
		_strstr

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future - 1-create_dynamic_lib.sh
	Script that creates a dynamic library called "liball.so" from all
	the ".c" files that are in the current directory.
